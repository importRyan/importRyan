ðŸ‘‹  Passionate about accessible apps and games. I'm an iOS engineer at the fintech [Empower](www.empower.me). Current open-source hobby project is [Colors We Can See](https://github.com/importRyan/Colors-We-See) that filters a camera feed with Metal color blindness shaders. It explores the latest Composable Architecture beta before a larger coffee-related payments project.

### Fun Libraries
* [MetaWear Swift Combine SDK](https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-Swift-Combine-SDK) â€” Stream BLE sensor data
* [Oklab](https://github.com/importRyan/oklab/) â€” A perceptual LAB color space useful for smooth gradients and parallel manipulations

### Past Apps
* [SeedFi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seedfi-money-help/id1543834789) â€” Modular Composable Architecture + SwiftUI for consumer credit building and lending
* [MetaWear](https://apps.apple.com/app/metawear/id1547334547) â€” Metal and SwiftUI for exploring BLE IMU sensor data during development
* MetaBase â€” Collect BLE IMU sensor data in research studies
